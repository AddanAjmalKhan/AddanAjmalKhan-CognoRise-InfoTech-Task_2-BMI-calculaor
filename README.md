🌟Update from my internship at CognoRise InfoTech🌟

I’ve successfully completed a hands-on task of building a BMI calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s a brief summary of what I did:

🔹 HTML: 
Created a form to input height (in cm) and weight (in kg).
Designed an interface for users to submit their data and view results.

🔹 CSS: 
Styled the calculator to ensure it looks modern and user-friendly.
Made it responsive for a seamless experience across various devices.

🔹 JavaScript: 
Implemented the core functionality to calculate BMI based on user inputs.
Added features to display the BMI value and categorize the result (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity).
